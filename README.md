## Building & running

The bot is written with **Discord.JS**, meaning you can host it on your computer via `node .` if you have the folder open in a command line.

When you open the project, you will see a `config.json` file. This is where all of the bot configuration will be placed. The only fields that are essential for running the bot are `token` and `botSpam`.

```config.json
token: 'Enter your own token here!'
prefix: '>'
botSpam: 'Enter ChannelID of your #bot channel.
```
