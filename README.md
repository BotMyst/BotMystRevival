This is the first day of working on it. Havent implemented dict command, researching..
Features Added:
Weather.js | Displays Weather |
index.js | Established command handler, and made it so commands can only be done in #bot. |
covid.js | Empty File (Will add a corona virus cases counter)|

To set the code to your own parameters all you need to do is change the token in the config,json file and specifiy your own botspam channel ID and boom functionality.
